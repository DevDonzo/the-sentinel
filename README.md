# The Sentinel 🛡️

**Autonomous SRE & Security Orchestration Agent**

The Sentinel is a production-grade, self-healing security agent designed to live within your GitHub ecosystem. It autonomously identifies vulnerabilities using enterprise tools, generates verified patches, and submits professional Pull Requests—all without human intervention.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🚁 **Remote Patrol**: Now supports patrolling **any** public or private GitHub repository. Simply provide the URL, and the Sentinel will clone, scan, and propose fixes.
- 🔍 **Deep Scanning**: Integrated with **Snyk** for dependency and container analysis, with a robust fallback to **npm audit**.
- 🧠 **Autonomous Diagnosis**: Intelligent prioritization of Critical and High-severity vulnerabilities.
- 🔧 **Self-Healing**: Automatically creates fix branches and patches `package.json` with secure versions.
- ✅ **Verification Pipeline**: Every fix is validated via `npm install` and `npm test` before a PR is ever opened.
- 🕊️ **Professional PRs**: Generates semantic Pull Requests with security labels, vulnerability details, and auto-assigned reviewers.
- 🔒 **Safeguarded Operations**: Operates under a strict "Rules of Engagement" constitution preventing unauthorized merges or access to secrets.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Sentinel operates as a coordinate "Council of Agents," ensuring separation of concerns and high reliability.

### The Agent Council
1.  **🛡️ The Watchman (Scanner)**: Monitors the environment for threats. Implements retry logic and atomic reporting.
2.  **🔧 The Engineer (Fixer)**: Analyzes threats and applies precision code patches on isolated feature branches.
3.  **🕊️ The Diplomat (Liaison)**: Manages the downstream communication and PR lifecycle on GitHub.

### 🏡 Mode 1: Local Patrol (Default)
Scan and fix the current project directory:
```bash
npm run build && npm start
```
